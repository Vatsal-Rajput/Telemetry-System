# Telemetry-System
Welcome to the IITK Motorsports Telemetry System repository! This project aimed at enhancing performance analysis, real-time monitoring, and data-driven decision-making for their Formula Student racing car.
# How to Run
One simple way to run the app is is through R studio.
# Content of App
This App contain three major parts stated below
- [Lap Analysis](#Lap_Analysis)
- [Subject Analysis](#Subject_Analysis)
- [Live Simulation](#Live_Simulation)
# Lap Analysis
The Lap Analysis module in our telemetry system empowers you to delve into the intricacies of each racing lap, providing valuable insights for performance optimization. One notable feature is the ability to compare G-force lateral (Glat) data using a scatter plot representation. This visualization allows you to assess the lateral acceleration at different points during the lap, aiding in the identification of key areas for improvement in vehicle dynamics and driver strategy. 
# Subject Analysis
In the Subject Analysis module, we introduce a comprehensive way to visualize various aspects of the car's behavior based on its position, providing a detailed perspective on critical parameters. One intriguing feature is the real-time visualization of the gear at which the car is operating at specific positions on the track.

As the car navigates through different sections of the racecourse, the gear data is dynamically displayed, offering insights into gear-shifting patterns and optimizing gear selection for each segment. This detailed analysis allows for a nuanced understanding of the car's performance, helping to fine-tune gear ratios and enhance overall efficiency.
# Live Simulation
The Live Simulation module offers a dynamic and real-time visualization of various aspects of the car's performance through live sensor data. Imagine being able to witness crucial parameters as they unfold during a race. One such example is the live visualization of the car's speed.Moreover, the Live Simulation module facilitates the recording and storage of this dynamic data. You can capture the entire race, preserving valuable information for post-race analysis and comparison. The real-time visualization and data logging capabilities make Live Simulation an indispensable tool for optimizing your car's performance on the track.
